title: ultimate tidbits
---
i spend a fair amount of time playing ultimate and i kept a note of the feedback i received and i wrote them down because i wanted to remember them. this is a page instead of a post because i plan to keep this page updated with the new pieces of advice i want to remember.
- Use hesitation in cuts to burn people.
- Do more creative cuts, don't always cut under.
- Watch people's hips on defense and don't let them go the way they want to.
- Take a breath when you have the disc, pivot and use fakes.
- Step out when you throw.
- Don't worry about where the disc is in the endzone, keep eyes on man.
- Think about the most important cut to take away.
- Practice throws under pressure.
- Snap wrist low and high.
- Keep weight centrally distributed.
- Don't commit hips until you know disc is downfield.
- In a side stack don't be hella tight on the man, be in the lane a bit.
- If they give you space, take the space. Don't run into them.
- Commit to going deep with cuts
- If hostack and zone, stay on the same side as a spreader
- Sleep more so you can be aware of what's happening on the field
- SLEEP LIKE SERIOUSLY
- Use triangulation for defense.  
- Stay tight on the man. Don't just give unders.
- Create negative space. If you don't get open move put of the space total space for other people.
- Jump up for the disc if you aren't sure how far away they are. Don't slow down to attempt to box them out. Calculate whether it's a better decision to box out or jump.
- For a deep cut, cut straight out deep then if there's no up call then cut across the plane and then if the throw doesn't go up then plant and cut across to the breakside.
- If you look reset, don't look away from the reset regardless of who it is. This wastes time.
- When in diamond, if you bid for the disc as the two or the three then you're letting them get the throws through the center which breaks the diamond.
- Your role is to not pick up the disc for the development of others but in the off chance you forget and do, don't panic.
- For the side stack set play, to almost guarantee getting the disc, cut deep hard and then come under instead of directly going to the disc.
- Be patient.
- To lead people with a throw, just throw to the space, don't modify the throw.
- You can throw actually pretty far with a normal flick. You don't need to rip an IO flick.
- If you think you can beat someone in the deep space, take away the under.
- Don't be a hero. Trust your teammates to do good things. Stand and look at the field and see what other people are doing before you make a movement. A fundamental cut is good but a holstering a fundamental cut so that your teammate can gain even more yards is even cooler.
- If you're a popper, sometimes you don't have to move to be in a viable position. Look around and take stock of where you are in relation to the disc and the other team.
- If you're playing zone, be aware of where they want to go and who is about to cut rather than focusing in on the hole between the 2 and 3.
- Red is forcing under and relying on switches whereas green is forcing out. Yellow is tight man defense.
- For pivoting, don't straight up and then step out. Go smoothly from backhand to forehand or vice versa.
